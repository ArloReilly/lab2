			<h1>A Really Funny Title</h1>
				<p id=boat> Nathan is a pretty dope lab partner and freshmen, hailing from east bay and currently residing in Porter the looney bin. He's a good guy though and doesnt seem like one of the crazy ones. Nathan loves to meander around the UCSC campus and eventually run into people he knows. On hot days he'll go to the beach with friends only to complain about how cold the water is. It's okay though because he has a good time regardless. He is an avid beliver in doodling so if you sit behind him in a lecture you will most likley see him doing so. Nathan is extremely terrified of coding because of lack of experiance and his inability to sepll.
				<p id=boat> Arlo is a second year art major and seems like an absolute chiller. He has been living in downtown Santa Cruz and also has made some welding projects in the past. He strongly believes that Ratatouille is the best movie of all time and also likes to go on night bikes around Santa Cruz. He never got to live on campus because of Covid but really loves living off campus, so he is now a sophmore that gets lost when walking around campus and has to ask freshmen for directions, which he says is embarrassing but necessary. He is also upset and mystified about why there are two Baskin buildings on campus twenty minutes away from eachother. Arlo as well as I is scared of coding for many of the same reasons that I am.</p>
